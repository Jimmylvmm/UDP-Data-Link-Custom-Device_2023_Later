		<h1>Receive Channel Configuration</h1> <!--REPLACE-->
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			<!--Global scheme of why this screen is important and how it relates to the general process of setting up the custom device.-->
			This page provides a means for importing a <a href="CFG - Configuration File.htm">Channel Configuration File</a> (*.csv) for data types, data order, and channels in the receive packet. Unlike the <i>Transmit Channel Configuration</i> page, applying this configuration will create all necessary receive channels if they do not exist already.
		</p>
		
		<h2>Configuration Summary</h2>
		<p>
			<!--Description/summary of the basic purpose of the controls on this screen.-->
			Channel data in a receive packet does not need to be manually reordered and have data types assigned using the configuration screen. Instead, a *.csv file can be used to import an existing definition for all data expected in the receive packet. Examples of thise file can be found with the custom device distribution. The configuration file import will modify any existing channels with matching names, and create any necessary channels to satisfy the remaining definition in the configuration file.  Any extraneous channels will also be removed. The configuration file not be fully imported and applied until the <i>Apply Config</i> button is pressed in the top menu.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the <i>Apply Config</i> button is pressed, the contents of the configuration file will take priority over any other channels, data typing, or order previously established for the receive packet. All the old channels will be removed and new channels will be added to best match the configuration file contents. Additional channels may be added after the configuration file is applied.<br><br>
