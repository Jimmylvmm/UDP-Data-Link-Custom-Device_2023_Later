		<h1>Packet Header</h1> <!--REPLACE-->
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			<!--What are the packet headers and what purpose do they serve?-->
			The packet header is used for communicating information about packet payloads to the packet receivers. These always preceed the actual data payloads in the transacted packet. The packet header is customizable (with some limitation). Packet headers are only relevant when working with non-buffered packets. It is advised when working within the UDP Custom Device that the transmitting and receiving endpoints of a packet have the same header. Failure to use the same header will result in parsing errors.

			<!--Description of what each header does.-->
			<table>
				<tr>
					<th></th>
					<th>Required?</th>
					<th>Size (bytes)</th>
					<th>Description</th>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><STRONG>Packet Size</STRONG></td>
					<td>Yes</td>
					<td>2</td>
					<td>Required in all packets. Occupies the first two bytes of a packet to communicate the size of the packet to the receiver. Includes the header and the channel data.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><STRONG>Protocol Revision</STRONG></td>
					<td>No</td>
					<td>1</td>
					<td>Tracks the revision of the of the Veristand Data Library and payload structuring for a packet. Should be statically set to 1.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><STRONG>System Definition Version</STRONG></td>
					<td>No</td>
					<td>8</td>
					<td>Tracks the version of the system definition. The two most significant bytes are staticaly set to zero. Starting at the third most significant byte, the payload breakdown looks like this:<br>
						[Major]	-	1 Byte<br>
						[Minor]	-	1 Byte<br>
						[Fix]	-	2 Bytes<br>
						[Build]	-	2 Bytes
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><STRONG>Source Node Name</STRONG></td>
					<td>No</td>
					<td>32</td>
					<td>A byte array that contains the first 32 bytes of the name of the Veristand Controller that produced the transmitted packet.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><STRONG>Packet ID</STRONG></td>
					<td>No</td>
					<td>4</td>
					<td><STRONG>Transmit:</STRONG> Identifies the index/order of the packet, as set in the system definition file.<br>
						<STRONG>Receive:</STRONG> Identifies the index of the transmit packet this receive packet is expecting to handle.<br>
						<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> Multi-packet transmission is not current supported on the same port.<br>
					</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><STRONG>Channel Count</STRONG></td>
					<td>No</td>
					<td>4</td>
					<td>Identifies the number of post-header channel data fields are present in the packet. Does not indicate the number of bytes the channels are using.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><STRONG>Sequence Number</STRONG></td>
					<td>No</td>
					<td>8</td>
					<td>Identifies the current transmit count of the packet. Starts at 0 and increments each time a packet is sent.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><STRONG>Timestamp</STRONG></td>
					<td>No</td>
					<td>8</td>
					<td><STRONG>Transmit:</STRONG>The current value on the Timestamp channel.<br>
						<STRONG>Receive:</STRONG>Not actively used at this time by receive packets. This field still needs to be allocated in the header if it is present in a transmission payload.<br>
					</td>
