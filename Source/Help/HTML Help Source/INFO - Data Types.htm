		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			<!--Global scheme of why this screen is important and how it relates to the general process of setting up the custom device.-->
			The UDP Custom Device, as of this time, only supports a small subset of the possible data types it can encode into a UDP stream and decode from a UDP stream. This page will cover the currently supported data types and any particular behaviors that may occur during encoding and decoding Veristand double channels.

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><STRONG>Boolean</STRONG></td>
					<td>
						<STRONG>Transmit Encoding:</STRONG> Converts from a Veristand double channel, to a 8-bit representation of a boolean value. Any value not equal to 0 will be converted to a boolean high; a byte with a value of 1. Any value equal to 0 will be converted to a boolean low; a byte with a value of 0.<br>
						<STRONG>Receive Decoding:</STRONG> Converts from a 8-bit boolean to a 64-bit, double-precision, floating point Veristand channel value. A boolean high (a byte with anything other than a 0 value in it) will be converted to a 1. A boolean low (a byte that is all zeroes) will be converted to a 0.<br>

					<td><STRONG>Single</STRONG></td>
					<td>
						<STRONG>Transmit Encoding:</STRONG> Converts from a Veristand double channel, to a 32-bit, single-precision, floating point value. Retains high levels of floating point accuracy, but the conversion times from a double to a single may be long in high channel counts transmissions.<br>
						<STRONG>Receive Decoding:</STRONG> Converts from a 32-bit single to a 64-bit, double-precision, floating point Veristand channel value. The resultant double after the conversion will still only be as precise as the single it is converting from.<br>
