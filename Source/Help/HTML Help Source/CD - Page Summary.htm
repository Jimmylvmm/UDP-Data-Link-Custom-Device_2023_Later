		<h1>UDP Custom Device Pages</h1> <!--REPLACE-->
		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>
			<!--Global scheme of why this screen is important and how it relates to the general process of setting up the custom device.-->
			The UDP Custom Device pages are used in a Veristand system definition to configure UDP packets that will be transacted across a network. It is important to make sure that all the pages are setup correctly to ensure that data is exchanged correctly. Certain errors in configuration will further prevent the system definition from deploying.

			<!--Description/summary of the basic purpose of this screen.-->
			Below is a quick listing of all the basic pages available in the UDP Custom Device. <br><br>

				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><STRONG><a href="CD - Main Page.htm">UDP Custom Device Main Page</a></STRONG></td>
					<td>The primary landing page when a new instance of the UDP Custom Device is created. Contains global import/export configuration and timestamp channel selection.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><STRONG><a href="CD - Transmit Packets.htm">Transmit Packets</a></STRONG></td>
					<td>Enumerates all the transmit packets currently setup. Provides menu buttons for creating and removing transmit packets.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><STRONG><a href="CD - Transmit Packet.htm">Transmit Packet</a></STRONG></td>
